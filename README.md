# Twitter Scraper Using Selenium
Laura Vodden

This Twitter scraper takes login and search term input to scrape data from Tweets using a Chrome browser - without the Twitter API. Tweets are saved as they are collected to a specified .csv file, so the scraper can be stopped at any point while retaining all collected data.

This scraper is a work in progress - I am currently implementing the following:

* Display number of Tweets scraped as a counter
* Specify number of Tweets to collect
